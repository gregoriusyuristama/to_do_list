## ToDoi: Privacy policy

Welcome to the To Do List: ToDoi app for Android & iOS!

This is my first flutter personal project, that available open source on initial release and will be available on google play and app store

As an avid Android and iOS user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The only data that will be stored to the cloud is the to do list you add on your app with the purpose the to do list will sync on the other device. 
To do list will be collected without us knowing the identity owner.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Gregorius Yuristama.
